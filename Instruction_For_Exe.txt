At the root project where /src, /dist and /build are located find package-win-exe.

Right click package-win-exe and edit as notepad.

Find set "APP_VERSION=1.0.*".

Change the app version incrementing the last value so that it wont override the previous version.

Save package-win-exe and close the notepad.

At the root project locate /dist and find "Information-Management.jar" and rename it to "Information-Management--Project-BSCS-2A.jar"

At the address bar located on top and below your file window
click the empty space, making sure delete the address written in it and type "cmd" and run.

inside the cmd terminal type ".\package-win-exe.bat" and press enter>

Wait for it to finish it might take one to several minutes to process.

Lastly at your root project find /out > /installer > exe file

Install.
